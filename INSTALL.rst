Installing scikit-image
==============================================================================

How you install ``scikit-image`` depends on your needs and skill:

- Simplest solution:
  `a scientific Python distribution <#scientific-python-distributions>`_.\

- If you can install Python packages and work in virtual environments:

  - `pip <#install-via-pip>`_

  - `conda <#install-via-conda>`_

- Easy with pitfalls: `system package manager (yum, apt-get,...) <#system-package-manager>`_

- `Your goal is to contribute to scikit-image <???>`_

Supported platforms
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Windows 64 bit on x86 processors
- Mac OSX on x86 processors
- Linux 64 bit on x86 processors

For information on other platforms, see `Other platforms <#other-platforms>`_.

Version check
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To see whether ``scikit-image`` is already installed or to check if an install has
worked, run the following in a Python shell or Jupyter notebook:

.. code-block:: python

  import skimage
  print(skimage.__version__)

or, from the command line

.. code-block:: bash

   python -c "import skimage; print(skimage.__version__)"

If it succeeds, you'll see a ``scikit-image`` version number, for instance

.. code-block::

   ???

If it fails, it will be obvious.

Scientific Python distributions
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In a single install you'll get Python, ``scikit-image`` and libraries
it depends on, and other useful scientific packages. They install into
an isolated environment, so they won't conflict with any existing
installed programs.

Drawbacks are that the install can be large and you may not get
the most recent ``scikit-image``.

We recommend one of these distributions:

- `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/>`_
- `Python(x,y) <https://python-xy.github.io/>`_
- `WinPython <https://winpython.github.io/>`_

To be sure you reference your installed version in the ``scikit-image``
documentation, run the `version check <#version-check>`_ above.


Installation via pip and conda
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These install only ``scikit-image`` and its dependencies; pip has an option to
include related packages.

.. _install-via-pip:

pip
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It's assumed you can use your system's command line to
install packages and are using a
`virtual environment <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html>`_

There's nothing to stop you from using pip without virtual environments,
but `it's a bad idea that will bite you later <???>`_. 
In particular, if you use ``pip`` without a 
virtual environment, ddo not use 'sudo' or install as root.

To install the current ``scikit-image`` you'll need at least Python 3.6. If your Python
is older, you can find a compatible version of ``scikit-image`` from
`an older release <https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/releases>`_.

??? explain how to install an older ``scikit-image``

.. code-block:: sh

  # Update pip to a more recent version
  python -m pip install -U pip
  # Install scikit-image
  python -m pip install -U scikit-image

To install related packages often included
in scientific python distributions use
the command:

.. code-block:: sh

    python -m pip install scikit-image[optional]

--- why no -U?



.. _install-via-conda:

conda
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Miniconda is a bare-essentials version of the Anaconda package; you'll need to
install packages like ``scikit-image`` yourself. Like Anaconda, it offers the
convenience of installing Python and providing virtual environments.

Adding packages can be unexpectedly slow as Miniconda works out dependencies.

- `conda documentation <https://docs.conda.io>`_
- `Miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_
- `conda-forge <https://conda-forge.org>`_ a channel maintained with the latest ``scikit-image`` package.


System package manager
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's best to skip the obvious choice of using a Linux package manager to install ``scikit-image``:

- it's probably backlevel

- you have  `the same version-hell potential<???>` as not using virtual
  environments with pip.

Other platforms
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We support Windows 32-bit on x86 processors at present but recommend switching
to Windows 64-bit.

We are very interested in how ``scikit-image`` is
`used <https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/issues/4375>`_.
Tell use the platforms you'd like to see ``scikit-image`` on!

Unsupported platforms include:

1. Linux on 32 bit x86 processors.
2. Linux on 32 bit on ARM processors (Raspberry Pi running Rapsbian):

   - While we do not official support this distribution, we point users to
     `piwheels <https://wwww.piwheels.org>`_
     and their
     `scikit-image's specific page <https://www.piwheels.org/project/scikit-image/>`_.

   - You may need to install additional system dependencies listed for
     `imagecodecs <https://www.piwheels.org/project/imagecodecs/>`_.
     See
     `issue 4721 <https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/issues/4721>`_.

3. Linux on 64 bit ARM processors (NVidia Jetson):

   - Follow the conversation on
     `Issue 4705 <https://github.com/scikit-image/scikit-image/issues/4705>`_.

While we do not directly support the platforms above, many of the core
developers have experience using the platforms listed above. Do not hesitate to
ask us questions pertaining to your specific use case.


The `developer instructions <how-to-contribute>`_,  describe how to build from source.

If you'd like to package ``scikit-image`` for a currently unsupported platform,
reach out on GitHub.
